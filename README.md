# Yazdan Ranjbar

Software Developer with more than seven years of hands-on experience architecting, developing, and maintaining
robust software solutions across web, mobile, and cloud environments. My background covers the full software development
lifecycle, from designing APIs and building scalable databases to implementing third-party integrations and delivering
user-focused applications. I have led development and technical teams, managed CI/CD pipelines, and optimized
infrastructure. My experience extends to developing industry-grade credit risk modeling (e.g. LGD, PD) pipelines and
advanced MLOps workflows, automating everything from data ingestion to deployment and monitoring.
I specialize in leveraging AI and GenAI to build intelligent systems, including predictive and generative models for
real-world business applications. Whether building native and cross-platform mobile apps, leading architecture design,
or deploying secure, high-performance cloud solutions, I bring a passion for automation, system design, and delivering
meaningful, reliable software at scale.
